# Project Title

Mandelbrot Set Visualization using Python

# What is the purpose of your Project 

This project is about drawing a special kind of picture called the Mandelbrot set. 
Itâ€™s made by doing a math recipe over and over to see how numbers behave. Some numbers stay calm, and others zoom off 
We color the picture based on how quickly the numbers escape. 
The result is a beautiful, swirly design that looks like art but comes from math

# How does your program work how to run it

This program creates the Mandelbrot set by dividing the screen into tiny points, each representing a number on a math grid 
(called the complex plane). For each point, the program repeats a math formula to see if the number stays small or grows big. 
It keeps track of how many steps it takes for the number to "escape," and uses those steps to pick a color for that point. 
When all the points are colored, the Mandelbrot fractal appears
To run the program, install Python, ensure matplotlib and numpy are installed, save the code in a file (e.g., mandelbrot.py), 
and run it with python mandelbrot.py.
